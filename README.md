# Programming & Problem Solving 🚀

This repository serves as a personal archive of my coding journey. It contains solutions to various challenges that I solve to sharpen my logic, improve code efficiency, and strengthen my understanding of programming fundamentals.

## 📁 Repository Structure

* **[/LeetCode](./LeetCode):** Solutions to interview-style problems focused on core logic and data structures.
* **[/Codeforces](./Codeforces):** Competitive programming problems, organized by difficulty rating to track logical growth.
* **[/VJudge](./VJudge):** A central hub for problems solved across multiple online judges and platforms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Languages:** C++, C, Python (primarily focusing on C++ for competitive programming).
* **Editor:** VS Code / GitHub Web Editor.
* **Platforms:** LeetCode, Codeforces, VJudge.

## 🎯 My Approach
1.  **Analyze:** Understanding the problem constraints and edge cases.
2.  **Implement:** Writing clean, readable, and efficient code.
3.  **Optimize:** Refining the solution for better time and space complexity.
4.  **Document:** Storing the solution here for future reference and growth tracking.
